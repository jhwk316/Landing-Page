This project was inspired by my 2 dogs, both of whom are huskies. Using the layout and color scheme provided by the Odin Project, I customized the page a little bit to make it more personalized. After tinkering around with a different color schemes, I decided to keep the color scheme as it works quite well with the subject matter.

This project leaned heavily on practicing flexbox. Flexbox was implemented in every section of the page. 

I certainly could use more practice but I feel like I've learned quite a bit about flexbox and look forward to using more.

I feel my project is ready to publish and I certainly welcome any comments or critique. 

Thank You
